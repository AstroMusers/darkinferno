DarkInferno is a package for computing the temperature profile of the Earth's inner core due to heating from dark matter annihilation.

DarkInferno consists of two scripts. One, darkinfernoradius.py, computes the steady-state temperature profile for given values of the dark matter mass and dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section. The other, darkinfernotimedependent.py, computes the temperature profile as a function of time, assuming a uniform initial temperature.

This repository contains both scripts, as well as a jupyter notebook demonstrating their usage.
